# Lab 1
## Introduction to Python

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and extensive libraries. It's widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. [1]

### Data Types in Python

Python offers a variety of built-in data types to handle different kinds of data:

- **Numeric Types**: `int` (integer), `float` (floating-point number), and `complex` (complex number).
- **Sequence Types**: `list` (ordered, mutable sequence), `tuple` (ordered, immutable sequence), and `range` (sequence of numbers).
- **Mapping Type**: `dict` (dictionary, a collection of key-value pairs).
- **Set Types**: `set` and `frozenset` (unordered collections of unique elements).
- **Boolean Type**: `bool` (represents `True` or `False`).
- **Text Type**: `str` (string, a sequence of Unicode characters).

Understanding these data types is crucial for effective programming in Python. [2]

### Control Structures in Python

Control structures manage the flow of a program. Python supports several control structures, including:

- **Conditional Statements**: Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to execute code based on conditions.

  ```python
  x = 10
  if x > 0:
      print("Positive")
  elif x == 0:
      print("Zero")
  else:
      print("Negative")
  ```

- **For Loops**: Iterate over a sequence (like a list or string).

  ```python
  for i in range(5):
      print(i)
  ```

- **While Loops**: Repeat as long as a condition is true.

  ```python
  count = 0
  while count < 5:
      print(count)
      count += 1
  ```

These structures are fundamental for directing the execution flow in Python programs. [3]

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Python fully supports object-oriented programming (OOP), a paradigm centered around objects and classes. The core concepts include:

- **Classes and Objects**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). Objects are instances of classes.

  ```python
  class Dog:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name

      def bark(self):
          print(f"{self.name} says woof!")

  my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
  my_dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy says woof!
  ```

- **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class derives attributes and methods from an existing class.

  ```python
  class Animal:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name

      def speak(self):
          print(f"{self.name} makes a sound.")

  class Cat(Animal):
      def speak(self):
          print(f"{self.name} says meow!")

  my_cat = Cat("Whiskers")
  my_cat.speak()  # Output: Whiskers says meow!
  ```

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class.

  ```python
  class Counter:
      def __init__(self):
          self.__count = 0  # Private attribute

      def increment(self):
          self.__count += 1

      def get_count(self):
          return self.__count

  counter = Counter()
  counter.increment()
  print(counter.get_count())  # Output: 1
  ```

- **Polymorphism**: The ability to present the same interface for different underlying data types.

  ```python
  class Shape:
      def area(self):
          pass

  class Rectangle(Shape):
      def __init__(self, width, height):
          self.width = width
          self.height = height

      def area(self):
          return self.width * self.height

  class Circle(Shape):
      def __init__(self, radius):
          self.radius = radius

      def area(self):
          import math
          return math.pi * self.radius ** 2

  shapes = [Rectangle(3, 4), Circle(2)]
  for shape in shapes:
      print(shape.area())
  ```

Embracing these OOP principles allows for the creation of modular, reusable, and organized code in Python. [4]

## Solved Problems

### Problem 1: Sum of Positive Integers

Write a program that reads a positive integer "n" entered by the user and then displays  
the sum of all integers from 1 to n.

The sum of the first n positive integers can be calculated as follows:

S = n(n + 1) / 2

#### Solution
The implemented solution was:

```python
# Ask the user for a positive integer
n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

# Check if the number is positive
if n > 0:
    # Calculate the sum using the mathematical formula
    sum_n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2  
    print(f"The sum of the first {n} integers is: {sum_n}")
else:
    print("Please enter a positive integer.")
```

This program calculates the sum of the first **n** positive integers using a simple formula. It first asks the user to enter a positive number and checks if the input is valid. If the number is positive, it applies the formula S = n(n + 1) / 2 to quickly compute the sum without using loops.

If the user enters a non-positive number, the program displays a message asking for a valid input. 

### Problem 2: Salary Calculation

Write a program that asks the user for the number of hours worked and the hourly wage. Then, display the corresponding payment on the screen.

#### Solution
The implemented solution was:

```python
# Ask the user for the number of hours worked and the hourly rate
hoursWorked = float(input("Enter the number of hours worked: "))
hourlyRate = float(input("Enter the hourly rate: "))

# Calculate the payment
payment = hoursWorked * hourlyRate

# Display the result
print(f"The payment for {hoursWorked} hours worked at a rate of {hourlyRate} per hour is: ${payment}")
```

The program calculates the total payment by multiplying the hours worked by the hourly rate. It takes user input for both values, converts them to `float`, and performs the calculation. The result is then displayed using an `f-string`, showing the hours, rate, and total payment in a clear format.

### Problem 3: Payroll Calculation for Multiple Operators

Create a list with at least six operators, each containing:
- Name  
- Hourly wage  
- Hours worked  

The program should calculate and print the total payment for each operator.

#### Soution
The implemented solution was:

```python
# List of operators with (Name, Hourly Wage, Hours Worked)
operatorList = [
    ("Joan", 15, 40),
    ("Miguel", 18.0, 35),
    ("Pablo", 20.0, 42),
    ("Emilio", 17.5, 38),
    ("Jesus", 16.0, 45),
    ("Valeria", 29.0, 37)
]

# Iterate through the list and calculate the total payment for each operator
for name, hourlyWage, hoursWorked in operatorList:
    totalPay = hourlyWage * hoursWorked
    print(f"{name} will be paid: ${totalPay:.2f}")
```

The program stores a list of six operators, where each entry contains a name, hourly wage, and hours worked. It then iterates through the list, calculating the total payment for each operator using: Total Payment = Hourly Wage * Hours Worked

Each operatorâ€™s payment is printed using an `f-string`, ensuring the output is formatted to two decimal places for clarity.

### Problem 4: List Operations

- Create a list called `numbers` containing at least 10 numbers.  
- Calculate the average of the even numbers.  
- Calculate the product of the odd numbers.  
- Print the results.

#### Soution
The implemented solution was:

```python
# Create a list with at least 10 numbers
numeros = [19, 20, 15, 22, 9, 10, 5, 18, 11, 6]

# Separate even and odd numbers
evenNumbers = [num for num in numeros if num % 2 == 0]
oddNumbers = [num for num in numeros if num % 2 != 0]

# Calculate the average of even numbers
averageEven = sum(evenNumbers) / len(evenNumbers) if evenNumbers else 0

# Calculate the product of odd numbers
productOdd = 1
for num in oddNumbers:
    productOdd *= num

# Print the results
print(f"Average of even numbers: {averageEven:.2f}")
print(f"Product of odd numbers: {productOdd}")
```

The program creates a list of 10 numbers and separates them into even and odd numbers using list comprehensions. It then calculates the average of even numbers by dividing their sum by the count, ensuring it doesn't divide by zero. The product of odd numbers is found by multiplying all values in the list. Finally, both results are printed with the average formatted to two decimal places.

## Problem 5: Guess the Secret Number

Create a program that asks the user to guess a secret number.  

- The program should generate a random number between 1 and 10.  
- The user must keep guessing until they find the correct number.  
- The program should provide hints if the guessed number is too high or too low.  
- The `while` loop should continue until the user guesses correctly.  
- At the end, print the number of attempts it took to guess the number.  

#### Soution
The implemented solution was:

```python
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 10
secretNumber = random.randint(1, 10)

# Initialize the attempt counter
attempts = 0

# Loop until the user guesses correctly
while True:
    # Get user's guess
    userGuess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))
    attempts += 1

    # Check the guess
    if userGuess < secretNumber:
        print("Too low! Try again.")
    elif userGuess > secretNumber:
        print("Too high! Try again.")
    else:
        print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number after {attempts} attempts.")
        break
```

The program generates a random number between 1 and 10 using `random.randint(1, 10)`. It then enters a `while True` loop, continuously asking the user to guess the number. Each guess increases the attempt counter.

The program checks if the guessed number is too low, too high, or correct:
- If the guess is lower than the secret number, it prints "Too low! Try again."
- If the guess is higher, it prints "Too high! Try again."
- If the guess is correct, it prints a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts, then exits the loop using `break`.


#### Soution
The implemented solution was:

```python
