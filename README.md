# Laboratory_LRT4102
This repository contains the codes and reports for the laboratory sessions of the Robotics Systems Design course (LRT4102). 

## Labs Included  

### [Lab 1: Introduction to Python for Robotics](./Lab1/)
This first lab focused on developing problem-solving skills in Python. The exercises covered:  
- Basic syntax and control structures (loops, conditionals, functions).  
- Handling lists and dictionaries.  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.  
- Implementing mathematical operations and algorithms.  
- Writing structured and efficient code for future robotics applications. 

The repository includes the solutions to the exercises, along with explanations and reports for each task.
